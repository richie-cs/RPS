# RockPaperScissors
This is my rock, paper, scissors project

# Problems
I had to create an interactive game that allowed the user to select an option, compare that option to an automatically generated CPU option, determine a winner, and keep score

# What I used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 

# What I learned
How to break a problem down into smaller parts and create snippets of code that solve individual problems, and then linking them together
